# 1. The idea
This project for now is just an idea of making simple UML modeling tool that would address problems with maintaining UML models in EA and similar tools.
# 2. Archeo project assumptions and requirements.
## 2.1 This shall be a desktop application
Unforetunetly not everyone have a good quality internet connection to work on Client-Server like applications. Fro me using EA (server behind corporate VPN) makes 1sec lag for every click. I really do not want to rely on internet connection.
## 2.2 Model file format shall be open text, structurized and schema based.
There are certain reasons to chose open readable format. 
- to ease processing model with whatever you want. 
- i want to version this file same as code in a git or svn or whatever you preffer.
## 2.3 This tool will be free for use and opensource forever.
